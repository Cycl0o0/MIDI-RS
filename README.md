# MIDI-RS - Black MIDI Visualizer

A high-performance Black MIDI visualizer written in Rust, designed to handle millions of notes with GPU-accelerated rendering using WGPU.

## Features

- **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: Uses WGPU for efficient rendering of millions of notes
- **Instanced Rendering**: Optimized for Black MIDI files with 100k+ simultaneous notes
- **Top-Down Note Display**: Notes fall from top to bottom like PFA (Piano From Above) software
- **Piano Keyboard Visualization**: Visible piano keyboard at the bottom shows which keys are being played
- **Interactive UI Controls**: Clickable buttons for playback control (in addition to keyboard shortcuts)
- **Real-time Performance Overlay**: FPS counter, note count, and frame time display
- **Configurable Quality Settings**: Multiple presets for different hardware capabilities
- **Slow Mode**: 30 FPS lock for stable YouTube recording
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy MIDI file loading via drag and drop
- **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Building

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- A GPU with Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 12 support

### Build Commands

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (optimized)
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
# Run without a MIDI file (use drag & drop to load)
cargo run --release

# Run with a MIDI file
cargo run --release -- path/to/your/file.mid
```

### UI Controls

The application features clickable UI buttons in the top-left corner:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| ▶/⏸ | Play/Pause |
| ⏮ | Reset to start |
| - | Decrease playback speed |
| + | Increase playback speed |
| 🐢 | Toggle slow mode (30 FPS) |
| 📊 | Toggle performance overlay |

### Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Play/Pause |
| `↑` | Increase playback speed (+0.1x) |
| `↓` | Decrease playback speed (-0.1x) |
| `P` | Toggle performance overlay |
| `S` | Toggle slow mode (30 FPS) |
| `R` | Reset playback to start |
| `F11` | Toggle fullscreen |
| `Q` / `ESC` | Quit |

### Loading MIDI Files

- **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag a `.mid` or `.midi` file onto the application window
- **Command Line**: Pass the file path as an argument when launching

## Visualization Layout

The visualization is laid out as follows:
- **Notes**: Fall from top to bottom (future notes above, past notes below)
- **Playhead**: Located near the bottom of the screen (15% from bottom)
- **Piano Keyboard**: Rendered at the bottom 12% of the screen
- **UI Controls**: Located in the top-left corner
- **Active Notes**: Piano keys light up when notes are being played

## Configuration

The application uses a `config.json` file for persistent settings. If not present, a default configuration will be created.

### Quality Presets

| Preset | Max Notes | Particle Density | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Low | 250,000 | 0.3 | Integrated GPUs |
| Medium | 500,000 | 0.6 | Mid-range GPUs |
| High | 1,000,000 | 1.0 | Dedicated GPUs |
| Ultra | 2,000,000 | 1.0 | High-end GPUs |

### Slow Mode

Enable slow mode (`S` key or 🐢 button) for:
- Consistent 30 FPS for YouTube recording
- Reduced particle effects
- Better frame time consistency

## Performance Tips

1. **Use Release Mode**: Always run with `--release` for best performance
2. **Reduce Quality**: Lower quality presets help with complex MIDI files
3. **Use Slow Mode**: For consistent recording, enable slow mode
4. **Close Other Applications**: Free up GPU resources for the visualizer
5. **Monitor GPU Temperature**: Black MIDI visualization can be GPU-intensive

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date
- Check that your GPU supports Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 12

### Low FPS
- Enable slow mode for consistent frame times
- Reduce quality settings in `config.json`
- Try a smaller MIDI file

### MIDI File Won't Load
- Ensure the file has a `.mid` or `.midi` extension
- Check that the file is a valid Standard MIDI File (SMF)
